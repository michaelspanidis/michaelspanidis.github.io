Welcome to my website! This site was made to showcase project's I've worked on. You can view them by clicking on the "Projects" tab at the top right-hand corner of the page; all projects come with full project reports that are available through my github (links to are provided via the project page).

A little bit about me: I am a recent chemical engineering graduate from Ryerson University. I have a passion for sustainability and an interest in the application of machine learning techniques to solve engineering problems. During my studies at Ryerson, I've worked co-operative education placements at Ontario Power Generation and Toronto Hydro Electric Systems Ltd; please see my LinkedIn for a detailed work history. Some of my skills include CAE/CFD, design (mechanical, thermal, process), data analytics and machine learning.
