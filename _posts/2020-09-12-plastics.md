Pelletizing is one of the final stages in the processing of polymers for manufacturing. Strand pelletizing baths operate by extruding cylindrical strands of polymers into some liquid media to cool the strand. This project is the solution to a design problem from my Plastics Technology course in my final years of studies. The solution required the preliminary design of a pelletizing bath strain extruder.

I've included the complete project document to my github. You can access it by [navigating to this link](https://github.com/michaelspanidis/michaelspanidis.github.io/blob/master/projectdocs/Design%20of%20a%20pelletizing%20bath%20strain%20extruder%20for%20polypropylene.pdf) and clicking the "Download" button near the bottom right corner of the screen.

# <span style="color:rgb(104,92,121);">What was done</span>
Some of the requirements for the design were:
* The extruding bed length
* A comparison of results assuming different conditions for thermal modelling

# <span style="color:rgb(104,92,121);">Software and platforms used to complete the project</span>
The project involved a variety of software and software packages.
* All diagrams included in the project were developed in Visio.
* 3D CAD was done in AutoDesk Inventor
* Plots were produced in MATLAB and Tableau
* Thermal modelling was done in MATLAB
