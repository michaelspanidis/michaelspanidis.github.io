# <span style="color:rgb(104,92,121);">About the project</span>
This project was an opportunity for me to learn the basics of the Python programming language and neural networks using genetic algorithms.

I've included the complete project document to my github. You can access it by [navigating to this link](https://github.com/michaelspanidis/michaelspanidis.github.io/blob/master/projectdocs/Process%20automation%20through%20the%20stochastic%20neuroevolution%20of%20fixed%20network%20topologies.pdf) and clicking the "Download" button near the bottom right corner of the screen. You can also view the full scripts used [here](https://github.com/michaelspanidis/michaelspanidis.github.io/tree/master/projectdocs/alien%20invasion).

# <span style="color:rgb(104,92,121);">What was done</span>
* The Alien Invaders game was created in Python
* An AI was developed using genetic algorithms that learned the optimum way to play the game

# <span style="color:rgb(104,92,121);">Software and platforms used to complete the project</span>
* The project was completed entirely in the Python programming language
