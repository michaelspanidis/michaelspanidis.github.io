All Chemical Engineering students participate in a design project that spans the entirety of their final academic year. Between the 2019-2020 academic year, I lead a group of 3 engineering students through the design of a Solar Thermal Power Plant in Canada. These power plants are typically located in the United States, Morocco, and China. The project was a feasibility study for the implementation of the technology in Canada to diversify the Canadian energy generating portfolio.
