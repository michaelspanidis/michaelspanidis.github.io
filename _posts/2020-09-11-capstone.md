There are stark implications related to our current energy use. In early 2020, the World Economic Forum reported that the risk of climate action failure presents a greater impact to the global society in comparison to the deployment of weapons of mass destruction. As a response, governments worldwide are looking for new, cost effective, and low carbon sources of energy that can meet the demands of their societies. Most renewable generating technologies, such as wind, solar PV, and hydro, are unlikely to replace fossil thermal generation. These traditional renewables generate in an inherently transient nature and have issues load following for peak periods in energy demand. However, recent innovations in non-conventional solar have presented the potential for renewables to compete with fossil thermal in terms of dispatch capability and efficiency. Rather than utilizing the photovoltaic effect, these systems, known as concentrating solar-thermal power, use large reflectors to focus and concentrate the heat from sunlight onto fluids to generate steam in downstream processes. The primary benefit of this technique is that the energy can be easily and efficiently stored.

All Chemical Engineering students participate in a design project that spans the entirety of their final academic year. Between the 2019-2020 academic year, I led a group of 3 engineering students through the design of a 1000 MW<sub>e</sub> concentrating solar-thermal power plant in Canada. The project was a feasibility study for the implementation of the technology in Canada to diversify the Canadian energy generating portfolio.

I've included the complete project document to my github, you can access it by [navigating to this link](https://github.com/michaelspanidis/michaelspanidis.github.io/blob/master/projectdocs/Sunwell%20Solar%20Power%20Facility%20Design%20of%20a%201000%20MW%20Concentrating%20Solar%20Power%20Plant.pdf) and clicking the "Download" button near the bottom right corner of the screen.

## What was done
Some of the requirements for the design were:
* A literature review of the technology
* Process and process control design
* Equipment design and sizing
* Safety and loss prevention considerations
* An economic/socio-economic analysis
* An assessment on the sustainability of the design

## Software and platforms used to complete the project
The project involved a variety of software and software packages.
* All diagrams included in the project were developed in Visio.
* Graphs and charts were developed in Tableau
* Piping and instrumentation diagrams (both 2D and 3D) were made using the AutoDesk suite.
* Optimizing algorithms were written in the R programming language
* Other platforms used to complete this project include: ASPEN plus/HYSYS, ANSYS, AutoDesk CFD, the Office Suite, etc.
