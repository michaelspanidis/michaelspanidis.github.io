# <span style="color:rgb(104,92,121);">About the project</span>
This was a personal project for me to apply my knowledge of heat transfer to design and build a liquid cooling heat transport system for my computer processor. Adequate cooling to these components are critical to optimize computer performance and prevent component failure.

I've included the complete project document to my github. You can access it by [navigating to this link](https://github.com/michaelspanidis/michaelspanidis.github.io/blob/master/projectdocs/Design-build%20of%20a%20heat%20transport%20system%20for%20electronic%20components.pdf) and clicking the "Download" button near the bottom right corner of the screen.

# <span style="color:rgb(104,92,121);">What was done</span>
I used principles of heat transfer to preliminarily size heat exchangers and get pumping requirements. These calculations were used to develop CAD of heat exchangers for CFD to validate preliminarily modelling. All theoretical calculations were used to provide an informed decision of required equipment specifications for purchases.

# <span style="color:rgb(104,92,121);">Software and platforms used to complete the project</span>
The project involved a variety of software and software packages.
* All diagrams included in the project were developed in Visio.
* 3D CAD was done in AutoDesk Inventor
* CFD was done in AutoDesk CFD
* Calculations were done in the R programming language
